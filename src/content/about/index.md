I'm a developer who loves understanding how things really work under the hood, not just assembling code, but truly grasping what's happening beneath the surface.

Curious by nature, I enjoy diving into new technologies, exploring different stacks, and investigating ideas from all angles. When I'm not building or learning, you'll find me tinkering with side projects, or exchanging knowledge with the dev community.
