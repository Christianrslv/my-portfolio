In October 2022, I joined IM Digital as a Frontend Developer and began working on building Shopify themes. I didn’t have much experience working with many coworkers, nor was I used to communicating in English, so it was a big leap and quite challenging at the beginning.

## Key Achievements

- Landed my first professional development role
- Contributed to major open-source projects
- Developed expertise in modern web technologies

## Impact

This period was crucial for building professional relationships and establishing myself in the tech community. The skills developed here became the cornerstone of my career.
