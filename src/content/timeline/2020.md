The year 2020 brought unprecedented challenges. Early on in college, I already had the opportunity to take part in one of the biggest challenges up to that point: a large project built from scratch, working across all areas of software development. With the support of my professors, we went through every stage — from requirements gathering, analysis, and prototyping to development, client validation, training, deployment, and server configuration. We did absolutely everything in this project; it was a truly comprehensive learning experience across all possible areas.

## Key Achievements

- Launched innovative digital products
- Adapted to new ways of working

## Impact

This transformative year accelerated digital adoption and opened new possibilities for remote-first development. The lessons learned continue to influence how I approach modern software development.
