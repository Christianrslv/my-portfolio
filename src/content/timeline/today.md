Currently, I am working at IM Digital. Nowadays, my focus has shifted more toward the backend, building store integrations with Shopify through the GraphQL Shopify API. I still work with frontend development, but recently I’ve been focusing more on this backend work.

## Current Focus

- Building modern web applications with cutting-edge technologies
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Sharing knowledge through writing and mentoring

## What's Next

The journey continues with an open mind and a passion for creating exceptional digital experiences. I'm excited to see what the future holds!
Looking ahead, I am exploring new possibilities and feel curious and excited about what the future holds with these new technologies and tools, which already enable significant advances in productivity.
